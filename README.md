# React hooks counter (testdrive)

This is a very simple counter application to play around with React's Hooks.

Additionally there is a Redux-like pattern which is using only useReducer() and useContext().

It's just a playground so it is untested.

## Install dependencies

`npm i`

## Start server

`npm start`
